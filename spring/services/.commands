docker build -t reveila-spring-boot:1.0 .

Explanation of the command:
docker build: The command to start the build process.
-t reveila-spring-boot:1.0: The "tag" flag. This names your image reveila-spring-boot and gives it a version of 1.0. You should use meaningful names and version numbers here.
.: The build context. This tells Docker to look in the current directory for the Dockerfile and the source files needed for the build.

docker run -p 8080:8080 --name my-running-app reveila-spring-boot:1.0

Explanation of the command:
docker run: The command to start a new container from an image.
-p 8080:8080: The "port mapping" flag. This maps port 8080 on your host machine (your laptop) to port 8080 inside the Docker container. This is essential for accessing your web application in a browser.
--name my-running-app: Assigns a human-readable name to your running container instance (optional).
reveila-spring-boot:1.0: The name and tag of the image you just built in Step 1.

Open your web browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:8080


To stop the container running in your terminal, press Ctrl + C.
If you ran the container in the background (using the -d flag, which is good for production), you would stop it using its assigned name:
docker stop my-running-app

To list and verify your Docker images, use:
docker images
# or
docker image ls

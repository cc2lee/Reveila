      1. Always start a task by reviewing the root '.roo/rules/' and any project-specific rules in sub-directories.
      2. Use Mermaid.js diagrams (sequence, class, or ERD) to illustrate all architectural proposals.
      3. Before suggesting a change to a backend Java API, explicitly analyze the impact on the Android-App and Web-App clients.
      4. When investigating build issues, use the 'command' group to run './gradlew' or 'npm' tasks.
      5. Maintain the 'Memory Bank' in the 'memory-bank/' root folder to track high-level design decisions.
